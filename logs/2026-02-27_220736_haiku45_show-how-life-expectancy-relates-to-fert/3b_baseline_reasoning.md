# Baseline Design

This scatter plot effectively shows the relationship between income (x-axis, log scale) and life expectancy (y-axis). The log scale for income is crucial because it reveals the non-linear relationship—diminishing returns at higher income levels. Circle size represents population, allowing viewers to see which countries are most populous. Color encoding by region reveals whether geographic/cultural patterns explain additional variance beyond income. The log scale transforms the wide income range (599-132,877) into a readable visualization. Tooltips enable detailed exploration of individual countries. This design answers the user's question: income clearly explains much of the life expectancy pattern, but regional clustering suggests other factors also play a role.
