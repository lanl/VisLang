# Draco-Informed Design

Following Draco's recommendations, I used point marks to show the relationship between life expectancy (health) and income across countries. The x-axis displays binned life expectancy values (10 bins) to reduce overplotting while maintaining the distribution pattern. The size channel encodes income level with a linear scale, allowing viewers to see how wealthier countries (larger points) correlate with higher life expectancy. Countries are listed on the y-axis sorted by life expectancy for easy comparison. Color is added by region to reveal geographic patterns in the income-health relationship. Tooltips are defined in the encoding channel (not as a mark property) to provide interactive exploration of country details. The design reveals whether income explains the life expectancy pattern: larger points (higher income) cluster toward higher life expectancy values, demonstrating the strong relationship between economic development and health outcomes.
