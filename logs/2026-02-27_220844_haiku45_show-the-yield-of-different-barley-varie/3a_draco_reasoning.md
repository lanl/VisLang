# Draco-Informed Design

Following Draco's recommendations, I used point marks with size encoding for mean yield to create a bubble chart showing variety-site combinations. The x-axis displays barley varieties and y-axis shows growing sites, allowing direct comparison of how each variety performs across locations. Size and color both encode average yield for redundant encoding and better perception. This design effectively answers both questions: which varieties perform best (larger points) and whether location matters (visual clustering patterns by site). The tooltip provides exact values for interactive exploration. The ordinal scales for variety and site preserve the categorical nature of these dimensions, while the linear size scale with zero baseline follows Draco's specification.
