# Baseline Design

This bubble chart is ideal for comparing three variables simultaneously: fertility (x-axis), life expectancy (y-axis), and population size (bubble size). The design choices are: 1) Scatter plot with circles to show the relationship between fertility and life expectancy; 2) Bubble size encodes population, allowing viewers to see if larger populations cluster in certain regions; 3) Color represents world regions (clusters), making geographic patterns visible; 4) Filtered to 2005 (most recent year) for clarity; 5) Square root scale for bubble size prevents large populations from dominating; 6) White stroke on circles improves readability with overlapping marks; 7) Comprehensive tooltips enable detailed exploration. The inverse relationship between fertility and life expectancy should be clearly visible, and regional clustering will show whether geography plays a role.
