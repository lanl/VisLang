# Draco-Informed Design

Following Draco's recommendations, I used point marks with age on the x-axis and sex on the y-axis, with population encoded as point size. To make this visualization more effective for comparing age distributions between sexes, I: (1) filtered to the most recent year (2000) to show current distribution; (2) converted numeric sex codes to readable labels ('Male'/'Female'); (3) added color encoding to reinforce the sex distinction and improve visual separation; (4) used a linear scale for age with zero baseline as recommended; (5) applied opacity and filled marks to handle potential overplotting; (6) included comprehensive tooltips for interactive exploration. The bubble chart effectively shows how population varies by age and sex, making it easy to spot differences in age distribution patterns between males and females.
